<h3>The Best Movies According to Tebogo</h3>
<h4>My top five movies of all time.</h4>
<hr />

<h3>The Fault In Our Stars</h3>
<p>This is by far my favourite move. 
the storyline was written beautifully.
I laughed so hard but the ending shocked me.I cried!!!<p>

<h3>Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>If you ever find yourself lost, not knowing how you are going to make it to the other side,
     wrestling with failure after failure, I recommend watching this movie. 
     Will Smith and his son are main characters. 
    The movie came out in 2006<p>
<h3>Me Before You</h3>
<p>If you are hopeless romantic like me, then this one is a must watch. 
    A really beautifully written story line<p>
